# Capstone1: Exploring ways to reduce CO Pregnancy Mortality rate



Colorado loses about 27 expecting or recent mothers each year.  The metric to track this in Colorado is called the Pregnancy Associated Mortality Rate or PAMR. The PAMR is calculate per 100,000 births and currently Colorado is the fifth lowest in the nation.

Unfortunatly, the United States is 34th out of 36th amongst OECD countries world health's "Maternal Mortality Rate" which counts mortalities during pregnancy and up to 41 days after birth.  Colorado's "Maternal Mortality rate" is 11.4 which would put Colorad about even with Greece and Chile.

Colorado is considered a leader of change on this topic as it institued "Maternal Mortality Review Committee' in 1993 and for over forty has had a special medicaid funding program called "Special Connections" which provide up to 12 months of residential substance abuse treatment for expecting and recent mothers.

Colorado University Anschutz Medical Campus study that encompassed 94 pregnancy-associated deaths from 2008-2016 show 30% (29 out of 94) of pregnancy associated deaths were due to overdose and suicide.  In this study the suicides by drug overdose was categorized as in the suicide category which is why its highlighted along with drug overdose in the chart below.
